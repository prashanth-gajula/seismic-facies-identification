# seismic-facies-identification
Seismic facies analysis is one of the most difficult tasks in the oil and gas sector, and it requires a lot of time and human resources to complete. By automating the process with deep learning techniques, both time and human effort will be reduced. Traditional Unet, Attention Unet VGG16 as the backbone, Unet Resnet18 as the backbone, and Unet Inceptionv3 as the backbone were used to solve this multi-class segmentation problem in this project. Our models are evaluated using Mean Intersection Over Union as a measure. All other models, with the exception of the classic Unet model, are learned using pre-trained imagenet weights. Traditional Unet performs the best out of all the models, with an average Iou of 0.87.
